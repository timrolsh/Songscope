# Songscope
A music discussion platform for everyone.
Easily find, discuss, and review the singles, artists, albums, and EPs you listen to, and discover the communities associated with all kinds of music.
Connect your Spotify account for easy integration with your Spotify library and music.
This project is open source, and everyone is welcome to contribute by opening issues and PRs.

# Code Formatting
All Typescript and Javascript files should be formatted using the Prettier configuration defined by the [prettierrc.json](./songscope_web/prettierrc.json) file in the root of the project. All TS/TSX and JS/JSX files should be in folder.
* Prettier comes as an extension for VSCode, but can also be added as a dev dependency if necessary
If iOS/Android Apps are ever made, there will be a formatting guide for those as well
